- ## üßæ1. Introduction
This report aims to analyze data related to lung cancer. Lung cancer is a major contributor to cancer-related deaths, making the study of its epidemiology and treatment outcomes paramount.  
This dataset provides an in-depth look at various factors linked to lung cancer diagnosis and management. It contains essential information on patient demographics, clinical histories, and treatment outcomes, enabling researchers and healthcare providers to better understand the disease's prevalence and development.

## üéØ1.1 Objectives
1. Examine the influence of age, gender, and country of residence on lung cancer diagnosis and treatment outcomes.
2. Explore the effects of comorbid conditions (such as hypertension, asthma, and cirrhosis) on treatment efficacy and patient survival.
3. Determine the role of family history in lung cancer risk and its implications for early diagnosis and intervention.
4. Assess the effectiveness of different treatment types (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy) on patient survival rates.
5. Investigate how BMI and cholesterol levels relate to lung cancer progression and treatment success.

## üßπ2. Data Cleaning Process

1. **Removing Duplicates**  
   - Used `drop_duplicates()` to identify and remove duplicate rows.  

2. **Checking Data Types**  
   - Used `data.dtypes` to confirm correct data types for each column and avoid errors during analysis.  

3. **Checking Null Values**  
   - Used `data.isna().sum()` to identify missing values, which could affect accuracy.  

4. **Checking Unique Values**  
   - Used `data.unique()` to check the number of unique values per column and detect anomalies.
